## Teams Manager
A simple react app where you can assign and unassign teams members and manage them. You can also take a look about the members belongs to which teams. I am using React Bootstrap for styling and routing is managing through React Router v6.

## Installation
Open the terminal from the root of your project directory and then run the following command to install the dependencies.

npm install

```
